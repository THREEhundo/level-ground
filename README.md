## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML & CSS

Brochure site using the basics. Built responsive using floats & flexbox.

## Optimizations

- Serve images based upon client screen size.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how floats work. In particular children that are all floated in a parent container. How the Block Formatting Context comes into play when having to clear floats. How flexbox is infinitely easier to implement.
